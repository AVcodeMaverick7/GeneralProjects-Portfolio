HW2 ADM - Group #7


In this assignment we perform an analysis of Taxis in NYC. We answer to the research questions (RQs) and Core research questions(CRQs) that will help Taxi drivers in planning their movements throughout the city and the Taxi's users to have hints about the convenience of enjoying this service.

P.S. Since our chrome browser can't render the chropleth map in the Jupyter notebook for CQR2, we deciced to save them as HTML file and push them to the github.
